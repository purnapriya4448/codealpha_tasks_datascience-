# Iris Flower Classification

This project is a machine learning classification task using the famous **Iris Flower Dataset**. The objective is to classify iris flowers into one of three species â€” *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, or *Virginica* â€” based on features like sepal and petal length and width.

##  Dataset Description

The dataset contains 150 rows and 5 columns:
- **Sepal Length (cm)**
- **Sepal Width (cm)**
- **Petal Length (cm)**
- **Petal Width (cm)**
- **Species** (Target label)

This is a well-known, clean, and balanced dataset provided by UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Objective

Build a machine learning model that can classify the species of an iris flower based on its physical features using:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Model training and evaluation

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

##  Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading**
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
4. **Visualization**
5. **Model Building**
    - Logistic Regression
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Decision Tree
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
6. **Model Evaluation**
    - Accuracy Score
    - Confusion Matrix
    - Classification Report
7. **Conclusion & Observations**

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Visualizations

- Pairplot of all features colored by species
- Correlation heatmap
- Confusion matrix for model performance

##  Final Model Accuracy

| Model               | Accuracy |
|--------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression| 97%      |
| K-Nearest Neighbors| 96%      |
| Decision Tree      | 95%      |
| SVM                | 97%      |
