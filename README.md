🚗 Car Price Prediction
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features such as brand, year, fuel type, transmission, and more. It uses regression algorithms to create an accurate prediction model.

📌 Project Overview
In the used car market, correctly estimating the price of a vehicle is crucial for both buyers and sellers. This project uses historical car data to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a car given various attributes.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about used cars, including:

Column Name	Description
Car_Name	Name of the car
Year	Year of manufacture
Selling_Price	Price the owner wants to sell the car
Present_Price	Price of the car when bought
Kms_Driven	Distance driven
Fuel_Type	Type of fuel used (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)
Seller_Type	Type of seller (Dealer/Individual)
Transmission	Transmission type (Manual/Automatic)
Owner	Number of previous owners

🚀 Workflow
Data Loading and Cleaning

Load the dataset

Handle missing values

Convert categorical variables using one-hot encoding

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize data trends

Correlation heatmaps

Price distribution analysis

Feature Engineering

Drop irrelevant columns (Car_Name)

Convert Year to car age

Encode categorical columns

Model Training

Train/Test Split

Apply Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost

Evaluate using R² score and MAE/MSE

Model Evaluation

Compare multiple models

Cross-validation

Prediction

Predict price of new input data

Deploy (optional)

📈 Results
The final model achieved an R² score of around 0.85+, indicating good predictive performance. Feature importance analysis revealed that Present Price, Car Age, and Fuel Type were the most influential factors.
